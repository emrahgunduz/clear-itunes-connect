# Hide Deleted In App Purchase Items For iTunes Connect

This is a Chrome extension for hiding deleted in app purchase items from the list.
Plugin simply removes the iap content from the table that are marked deleted.

You can download the code and install the plugin in development mode if you like.
Or use the crx file I provided.

It is also possible to install the plugin from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-iap-list/cjkidlkeiiakklkkcjjdelfijmccmilc).

Extension detect the iTunes Connect IAP page and waits for the list to load.
After, the deleted items get removed from the table.
If the on-load action fails, you can tap/click the extension icon.
